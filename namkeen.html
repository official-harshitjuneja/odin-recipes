    Typical namkeen snacks in Indian cuisine include khaara, farsan, chivda, sav, chips, and bhujiya. Namkeen of Indore and
    ratlam are two snacks that are very well known for their tastes. There are a few other Indian snacks that incorporate salt
    and have a namkeen flavor, some of which are made from basic grains and can be flavored in a multitude of ways. These kinds are
    therefore similar to each other but have different names. Many of the namkeen snacks include sev, a versatile crunchy snack
    that can be flavored with all sorts of spices. Sev looks similar to the Chinese hard noodles served in American Chinese food.
