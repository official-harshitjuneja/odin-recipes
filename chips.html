    A potato chip (often just chip, or crisp in British and Irish English) is a thin slice of potato that has been either deep
    fried or baked until crunchy. They are commonly served as a snack, side dish, or appetizer. The basic chips are cooked and
    salted; additional varieties are manufactured using various flavorings and ingredients including herbs, spices, cheeses,
    other natural flavors, artificial flavors, and additives.

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Potatoes</li>
    <li>Vegetable Oil</li>
    <li>Onion Powder</li>
    <li>Spices</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Butter</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Wash the Potatoes</li>
    <p> Take whatever quantity of potatoes you like. Here I have taken five medium sized potatoes and washed them in running water
        to remove mud particles sticking to them
    </p>
    <li>Make Thin Wafers</li>
    <p>I have used a hand tool to make the potato wafers. The thickness of the blade can be adjusted in the hand tools.
        I have adjusted it to as thin as possible to make wafers of the washed potatoes.</p>
    <li>Spread the Wafers on a Clean Cloth</li>
    <p> As soon as you slice the wafers, spread them on a clean cloth. The moisture in the potato wafers will be absorbed by the
    cloth. This will make the potatoes to cook quickly as well as consume less oil while deep frying.
    <p>
        <li>Deep Fry the Potato Wafers</li>
        <p>Heat enough oil in a frying pan. when the oil is hot enough, add the potato wafers one by one. Deep fry till
            they are crispy.
        </p>
        <li>Remove From Oil and Serve</li>
        <p>Once the potato wafers turns to golden brown remove from the pan and drain out the oil.
           Sprinkle salt over this and serve. If you like it spicy, you can add red chili powder to salt and
           sprinkle on the wafers.</p>
